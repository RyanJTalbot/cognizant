    "\n",
    "Therefore, as the Data Scientist that created this algorithm, it is your job to prepare a Python module that contains code to train a model and output the performance metrics when the file is run. Additional information about Python modules and running Python files is provided in the additional resources. You can assume for this task that the Python file does not need to process, clean or transform the dataset. The Python file should be able to load a CSV file into a data frame, then immediately start training on that data. Assume that the CSV file will contain the same columns as the dataset that you trained the model on in the previous task.\n",

    "\n",
    "Good quality code should be planned and should follow a uniform and clear structure. Before you start writing the Python module, take some time to think about how you want to structure this file and what needs to be included from your notebook. It is your choice whether you’d rather write it all in 1 block, separate it out into functions, or create a class with methods. Depending on your ability with coding, you may take a different approach. A starter file “module_starter.py” is provided, which gives some hints as to how you may want to structure the file. If you’re a beginner, you may also want to make use of the file named “module_helper.py”, which includes some functions that you may want to make use of. If you do use this helper file, you can simply copy and paste the functions that you would like to use into the module that you’re writing. This should take 5-10 minutes. \n",

    "\n",
    "After planning the module that you’re going to write, you can start creating your file! Be sure to follow a consistent and clear structure, and use the additional resources for best practices. Also be sure to include plenty of comments and documentation, because the ML engineering team is not the team that wrote this code. Remember, you can assume that the Python file does not need to process, clean or transform the dataset. You can load the Python file as a CSV file directly into a data frame, and then immediately start training on that data. Assume that the CSV file will contain the same columns as the dataset that you trained the model on in the previous task. This should take you 30-40 minutes. \n",
